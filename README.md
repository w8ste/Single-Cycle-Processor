## Single-Cycle Processor

### Building blocks
The block folder contains the associated files. 

#### adder
The adder module is fairly straight forward. The adder takes two parameters,
adds them together and outputs the result.

### Appendix
- This project is based on the book `Digital Design
and Computer Architecture` by Harris & Harris and their implementation of a Single-Cycle-Processor.
- Im only learning how to optimize with [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), which is why it is possible, that the synthesized product is a bit blown out of proportion.
